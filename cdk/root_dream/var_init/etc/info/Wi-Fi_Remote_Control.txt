C16 DM500 Remote Control via Smart Phone or Tablet - by daverave 09 Feb 2017
============================================================================

This new yWeb feature gives you the abilty to control your DM500 via your smartphone
or tablet via your home LAN network. It replaces the previous (android-only) version
by hotbaws11 in C15 with a tasty-looking and colourful 3D effect keypad.

In order to use your phone or tablet as a 'virtual' remote control, you will need:
1. A smart phone/tablet with a web browser and wifi access
2. An internet connection to your DM500 cable or satellite box.

First check that your DM500 is connected to your home network and make a note of
its I.P. address (Menu > Settings > Network > Show Active Network Settings)

Then, on your phone or tablet web browser enter {I.P. box}/rc.yhtm
( eg: 192.168.1.120/rc.yhtm ) Save it as a bookmark in your browser!

And that's it! You now have access to your dreambox via your phone or tablet!

Please test it out and give me any feedback regarding any bugs found, or any
enhancements you think might improve this handy tool:

used and the operating system. (e.g. Chrome, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Android 5.0 )

Thanks, and ENJOY! Daverave- for UkCvs.net 09 Feb 2017
